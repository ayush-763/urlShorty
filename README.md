# Url Shorty
This is a basic backend project where we used NodeJS, MongoDB and EJS to build a url shortening website which when provie with the URL of a website, changes it into a simpler short version. This uses shortid package from npm, it also shows the number of times the short url was used.

## How it works 
 1. Download the zip.
 2. Install the dependencies.
 3. Start the app.
 4. Using localhost:8001 in chrome browser we can generate the shortids and redirect it to the website. Example: localhost:8001/shortid
